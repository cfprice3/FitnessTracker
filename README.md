### **1. Installations:**
A requirement for using this repo is installing the "express," "mongoose," "body-parser," and "morgan" npm packages.

Open the terminal and type "npm init" to create a package JSON file.  Next, type "npm install express", "npm install mongoose", "npm install body-parser", and "npm install morgan" to download the needed packages.


### **2. Usage:**
After installing the npm packages, in your terminal command line type "node server.js". The server will load onto PORT 3000.  You can then select a new exercise, input the stats of the workout, and the save those stats to view in the graphs.

You can also use the Heroku link to use just the application without utilizing the repository files to create your own app.
